study @.agent/specs/README.md
study @.agent/tasks/phase2-openrouter-byok and pick the most important task to do and work on it
explore the codebase before starting tasks

under .legacy/ lives the backend code before the migration
create tests before implementation (if not already covered)
author property based tests or unit tests or use playwright cli for app functions (which ever is the best)
study existing code before implementing
after making changes to files run the tests
when tests pass, commit and mark the task complete in phase2-openrouter-byok.md, dont move to the next task!
